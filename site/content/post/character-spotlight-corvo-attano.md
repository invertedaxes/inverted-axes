  Action based stealth games are more than just a my favourite genre of game for
  me. They were a first love in my introduction into gaming. Games like Splinter
  Cell, Thief and and Tenchu: Stealth Assassins opened my eyes to the idea of a
  game being more that just hacking and slashing your way through generic story
  line; that there was more than one way to play a game. The reason I bring up
  this strange but wonderful love of stealth games is because I’d like to talk
  about a character from one of my favourite games, Dishonored. This character
  is the rough and mysterious  bodyguard-turned-assassin, Corvo Attano.

Before I dive into the man, the myth, the guy with a kickass mask, I’d like to take a quick look into the development of Dishonored. Arkane Studios, founded in 1999, had been a relatively successful independent company coming out with games like a sequel to the Ultima Underworld series as well as Arx Fatalis. They even worked with Ubisoft, tailoring their Arx Fatalis engine to Ubisoft Might and Magic game before they were picked up by Bethesda’s Parent company, ZeniMax Media in 2010. Bethesda Softworks announced Dishonored a year later and in the fall of 2012 we were introduced to our enigmatic man, Corvo Attano.

So I’ll give a somewhat brief explanation of the rugged man in black before he became, well the rugged man in black. Born on 25th Day, Month of Nets in 1798, our young lad grew up in the not-so-quaint town of Karnaca.  While born into a lower class home, Corvo lived a happy life. At least, until his father was killed in a tragic accident. After his father's passing he lived briefly with his sister until she disappeared without a trace. After that, Corvo was forced to live on the mean streets of Karnaca. Growing up under these conditions turned his will into steel as sharp as the blade he had perfected to use. By age 16 he was proficient enough with the blade to win the biggest dueling tournament in Serkonos; landing him a sweet gig as an officer in the Serkonan guard. After two impressive years of  serving Serkonos, Theodanis Abele, the Duke of Serkonos sent Corvo to Dunwall, as a gift, to serve Emperor Euhorn Kaldwin. A year of service in Dunwall, Corvo became the Royal protector to Jessamine Kaldwin, the Emperor's daughter. The two formed a deep bond and eventually became lovers.



Dishonored takes place years later after Corvo has returned from a long journey. Shortly after returning Jessamine is murdered right in front of him and you are framed for her murder and your journey for revenge or justice begins here.



I’ve always found Corvo to be one of the more interesting characters that I’ve come across over the years. While you don't get to know a lot about him (throughout the game at least) you really get a sense of who he is based on the actions he takes thought out the game. Hell he doesn’t even talk in the first one, yet based on the hard choices that Corvo, and you as the player, have to make gives you a grasp on this game’s moral dilemmas. Corvo is the moralic lens you see this world through.  Dunwall is a pretty desolate place during the course of the game. A terrible plague has ravaged the city, it's filthy, full of corruption, and after being framed for the murder of the empress everyone in it wants to see your head on a pike. Corvo, faced with the weight of his duty to the dead on his shoulders must to choose to rise above the filth and be a shining beacon for Dunwall or become darker and harder than the black stained city itself. You as the player have to make that choice, and it isn't always a simple black and white answer. Do horrible people deserve to die because of their action? Is sparing the life a murderer worth it if it helps further your cause? Knowing that by sparing them that they may get away with their crimes? This is just the surface of what the city of Dunwall and its inhabitants have you figure out with every choice you’re faced with. Corvo, The Royal Protector, is a man of strong will and is incredibly driven. He also cares deeply for those close to him. The question is, will he be willing to give up his humanity to save the people he loves? Or is there a better way to cleanse Dunwall of its filth while also keeping his soul intact?

Arkane Studios designed a very strong and prolific character. A kid who fell upon hard times and rose through it despite the hardship. It carried on into adulthood and is the foundation of who he is. I love this character and this game because it reaches into the very depth of what drives people in dire circumstances and Corvo is the perfect subject to live through vicariously. If you want to see this character in all its glory you can find him in Dishonored and Dishonored 2 titles. You can also find him in a graphic novel Dunwall Archives, a mini comic series called Wyrmwood Deceit and a canon Novel called The Corroded Man.

I was born under a full moon in the Year of the Game Boy, so ultimately I was fated to love video games from the day of my first spawn. And with less gross phrasing, I was blessed to grow up in a home where both Nintendo and Sega were treated as equals. While the endless barrages of the early console wars exploded overhead, I was spending my days goomba-stomping, hedgehog-racing, and laying the beat down as green, bipedal, cold-blooded fighters.

Nowadays, I like to play games and then tear them apart to uncover what makes them great, and what makes them bad- or worse... _average_. My gaming passion lies in platformers, beat'em ups, and above all else- co-op games.

Around here I'll be streaming, keeping this website working, and occasionally writing some opinions pieces and reviews.

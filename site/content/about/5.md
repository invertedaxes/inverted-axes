I remember getting the Super Nintendo Donkey Kong Country bundle for my fifth birthday and the excitement rushing over me. Only issue was I didn't quite understand what this thing was, but hey it had a pretty cool ape on the box. With a little help from my dad (ok a lot of help) we turned that sucker on and seeing that Donkey Kong Country spash screen I was hooked. Over the coming birthdays I was introduced to the PlayStation era and getting a copy of Metal Gear Solid and Fifa 99 at a flee market I was even more enthralled into gaming. The story telling and the excitement of scoring my first goal in a game gave me a sense of wonder and awe. Can't forget getting a copy of Final Fantasy 7 for Christmas from my mom on a whim and solidifying my love for games ever since. At the end of the day I have to thank my parents for getting me hooked on this hobby and never letting it go.

Now a days I play almost everything that seems to catch my interest. RPG's, sports, shooters, and everything in-between I play it all. Except for Halo (I only joke, Mostly). There isn't anything I won't try once, but forget about beating games. I'm notoriously bad for not beating games I start.

I'll be writing, recording and editing our YouTube videos. As well as having an occasional rant or two on our podcast The 100% Human Video Game Show.

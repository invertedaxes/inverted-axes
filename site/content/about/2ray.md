I’m fascinated by the inexorable march of time, and the progress it brings. It seems like only yesterday I was excited by the new graphical prowess of the Nintendo 64!

As we move forward into new and exciting realms of home entertainment like the upcoming Playstation and the Oculus Quest, I think it’s important to remember where we came from to truly appreciate how we’ve come.

My passion lies with the classics like the Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis, and tracking how each progressive iteration of their games and hardware led us to where we are today.

I enjoy writing what I hope are thoughtful reviews, retrospectives and playing my Monday show on Twitch, *ABCs of Gaming*!

My aim with *ABCs of Gaming* is to beat 26 games this year, one for each letter of the alphabet.

For as long as I can remember, I’ve been fascinated by stories. I would

devour every story I was told, and later every book I could get my hands

on. One day, I was introduced to _Pitfall! _on the Atari and suddenly I

was able to take control of a character that seemed to be right out of the

stories I loved. From that point on, I was nearly obsessed with exploring

as many worlds and stories that I had the chance to. Over time I learned

to fall not just for the stories, but the art and mechanics that came with

so many different titles. This is what lead me to want to share my

experiences with others.



From Early Access to Esports, there isn’t much in the gaming world I don’t

try and keep an eye on. I love watching competitive games and tournaments,

play story-driven games, and mess around in the many sandboxes out there.



You can catch me streaming, writing the odd piece, and hanging around on

our social media.

      I was born under a full moon in the Year of the Game Boy, so ultimately I
      was fated to love video games from the day of my first spawn. And with
      less gross phrasing, I was blessed to grow up in a home where both
      Nintendo and Sega were treated as equals. While the seemingly endless
      barrages of the early console wars exploded overhead, I was spending my
      days goomba-stomping, hedgehog-racing, and laying the beat down as green,
      bipedal, cold-blooded fighters.


      Nowadays, I like to play games and then tear them apart to uncover what
      makes them great, and what makes them bad- or worse... average. My gaming
      passion lies in platformers, beat'em ups, and above all else- co-op games.


      Around here I'll be streaming, keeping this website working, and
      occasionally writing some opinions pieces and reviews.

      I’m fascinated by the inexorable march of time, and the progress it
      brings. It seems like only yesterday I was excited by the new graphical
      prowess of the Nintendo 64!


      As we move forward into new and exciting realms of home entertainment like
      the upcoming Playstation and the Oculus Quest, I think it’s important to
      remember where we came from to truly appreciate how we’ve come.

      My passion lies with the classics like the Nintendo Entertainment System
      and Sega Genesis, and tracking how each progressive iteration of their
      games and hardware led us to where we are today.


      I enjoy writing what I hope are thoughtful reviews, retrospectives and
      playing my Monday show on Twitch, ABCs of Gaming! 

      My aim with ABCs of Gaming is to beat 26 games this year, one for each
      letter of the alphabet.

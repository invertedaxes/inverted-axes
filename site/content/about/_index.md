    body: "I was born under a full moon in the Year of the Game Boy, so ultimately I was fated to love video games from the day of my first spawn. And with less gross phrasing, I was blessed to grow up in a home where both Nintendo and Sega were treated as equals. While the seemingly endless barrages of the early console wars exploded overhead, I was spending my days goomba-stomping, hedgehog-racing, and laying the beat down as green, bipedal, cold-blooded fighters.\r\n\nNowadays, I like to play games and then tear them apart to uncover what makes them great, and what makes them bad- or worse... _average_. My gaming passion lies in platformers, beat'em ups, and above all else- co-op games.\r\n\nAround here I'll be streaming, keeping this website working, and occasionally writing some opinions pieces and reviews."

    body: "I’m fascinated by the inexorable march of time, and the progress it brings. It seems like only yesterday I was excited by the new graphical prowess of the Nintendo 64!\r\n\nAs we move forward into new and exciting realms of home entertainment like the upcoming Playstation and the Oculus Quest, I think it’s important to remember where we came from to truly appreciate how we’ve come.\r\n\nMy passion lies with the classics like the Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis, and tracking how each progressive iteration of their games and hardware led us to where we are today. \r\n\nI enjoy writing what I hope are thoughtful reviews, retrospectives and playing my Monday show on Twitch, ABCs of Gaming! \r\n\nMy aim with ABCs of Gaming is to beat 26 games this year, one for each letter of the alphabet."

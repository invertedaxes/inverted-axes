    body: "For as long as I can remember, I’ve been fascinated by stories. I would devour every story I was told, and later every book I could get my hands on. One day, I was introduced to Pitfall! on the Atari and suddenly I was able to take control of a character that seemed to be right out of the stories I loved. From that point on, I was nearly obsessed with exploring as many worlds and stories that I had the chance to. Over time I learned to fall not just for the stories, but the art and mechanics that came with so many different titles. This is what lead me to want to share my experiences with others.\r\n\nFrom Early Access to Esports, there isn’t much in the gaming world I don’t try and keep an eye on. I love watching competitive games and tournaments, play story-driven games, and mess around in the many sandboxes out there.\r\n\nYou can catch me streaming, writing the odd piece, and hanging around on our social media."

    body: "I was born under a full moon in the Year of the Game Boy, so ultimately I was fated to love video games from the day of my first spawn. And with less gross phrasing, I was blessed to grow up in a home where both Nintendo and Sega were treated as equals. While the seemingly endless barrages of the early console wars exploded overhead, I was spending my days goomba-stomping, hedgehog-racing, and laying the beat down as green, bipedal, cold-blooded fighters.\r\n\nNowadays, I like to play games and then tear them apart to uncover what makes them great, and what makes them bad- or worse... _average_. My gaming passion lies in platformers, beat'em ups, and above all else- co-op games.\r\n\nAround here I'll be streaming, keeping this website working, and occasionally writing some opinions pieces and reviews."

    body: "I’m fascinated by the inexorable march of time, and the progress it brings. It seems like only yesterday I was excited by the new graphical prowess of the Nintendo 64!\r\n\nAs we move forward into new and exciting realms of home entertainment like the upcoming Playstation and the Oculus Quest, I think it’s important to remember where we came from to truly appreciate how we’ve come.\r\n\nMy passion lies with the classics like the Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis, and tracking how each progressive iteration of their games and hardware led us to where we are today. \r\n\nI enjoy writing what I hope are thoughtful reviews, retrospectives and playing my Monday show on Twitch, ABCs of Gaming! \r\n\nMy aim with ABCs of Gaming is to beat 26 games this year, one for each letter of the alphabet."
